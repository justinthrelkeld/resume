# Why?

I created a git repo for my résumé as an experiment. The idea is simple: showcase my tech skills in a way that showcases my tech skills

Eventually, this repo will serve as a visible (and interactive!) source for my website, hirejustinthrelkeld.com.

The site will be hosted via github pages and (possibly?) mirrored on a cloud-based deployment solution. It's just a question of how far I take this.

Currently, I'm using markdown for the content, but I intend to represent much of it as JSON and other data formats. 
Eventually, I would like to have a logical, programmatic flow for taking data from one format into multiple others.
Possibly, I would start with a JSON file and build a semantic, rich-markup HTML file and a flat markdown file for different purposes.


*in other words, why not?*
