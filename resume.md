## Experiences
### Lonely Planet
Projects have touched just about every aspect of the company: internal workflow tooling, prototyping of new products, product landing pages, client campaigns, and core product features. Responsibilities included collaboration with designers to develop design concepts that could be executed within the parameters of the project, working closely with project managers to identify key outcomes and refine aspects that had technical implications, working as part of a team to manage workload and provide support to other project groups, identifying workflow pain-points and developing solutions to make life easier and the team at large more effective. Often took on project management responsibilities when projects moved faster that managers could be assigned.

### Hello Friend Design Company
Founded a local design and strategy consultation agency. I oversaw the day to day operations, developed pitches, provided creative direction, and constantly sought out new opportunities. Projects ran the gamut: from posters for a neighborhood yard sale to the creation of an identity for a nonprofit working with victims of human trafficking to organizing a grassroots community art movement. Learned a lot about client services, self promotion, and the local business community.

### 323 Creative Group
Helped co-found a small digital agency focusing on independent musicians and small businesses. Developed all promotional strategy, brand guidelines, agency materials, etc. Also set creative workflow and policies. Client work included event materials, promotional videos, identity concepts, and website design.

### Nashville Parent Magazine
Managed all things digital for a regional publication. As part of a four-person production team, worked under the production coordinator to deliver both the print and digital product for a monthly publication. Responsibilities included working with advertising sales team to keep online inventory up to date, design of digital ad copy, collaborating with editorial team to keep content up to date, and working with a part time web developer to maintain and enhance a WordPress powered custom content management platform. Notable accomplishments: launched and guided a redesign concept that increased salable  advertising inventory by over 200% and improved ad targeting capabilities.

### MTSU's Office of Marketing and Communications
Assisted the Web Marketing Specialist by creating graphics for online use, monitoring social media, and participating in projects that included video editing, web design, photography, and copy editing tasks.

#### Notable Projects

- Dynamic online landing page to compliment the University’s student recruitment packet

- HTML5 campus tour web application

- Web production for the University’s holiday greeting card

- Developed a cost-free solution that harnessed Twitter to target high school students by via automatic follow-back messages to selected users, inviting them to local meet-and-greet events.

### Course Work
I had the opportunity to lead a team of five students in creating a campus-focused integrated marketing campaign for a national lobbyist organization. With a $3,000 budget, we achieved 3.6 million impressions, increased positive awareness of messaging by 22 percentage points, and generated $11,541 in total value.

I was responsible for ensuring successful completion of the campaign. I interviewed and selected candidates for team roles, guided exploration of the client’s problem, and wrote or edited summaries for all proposed ideas. Our final campaign included four printed advertisements, a Twitter contest, a Facebook fan page, press releases & interviews, three 15-second YouTube videos, on-campus event. 

While the results were by all accounts an overwhelming success, we had several personnel issues and ran into conflicts between the campaign objectives and our course requirements.

### MTSU Sidelines
As primary point of contact and representative for Sidelines advertising worked with the advertising sales team at a local Gannett-owned newspaper to identify contacts interested in advertising with MTSU Sidelines.

Within four weeks, we increased the average weekly advertising revenue by 138% allowing the once-a-week publication to expand from 16 to 24 pages.
